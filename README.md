# Customizable Crafting Table
This is a simple, yet highly customizable crafting table made to work with all gamemodes. Below are it's current features. For a more detailed explanation of this addon, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1793133869">click here.</a>
- Not hard coded to accept specific entities like other crafting systems.
- Accepts any entity as an ingredient and/or craftable item. (As long as the item is configured correctly.)
- Allows for an infinite amount of new items to be added.
- Button that allows players to manually remove ingredients from the table.
- Extra ingredients leftover after crafting an item stay in the table for another use.
- Customizable sounds, UI colors, table appearance, table health, and item spawn function. Some elements such as sounds, table appearance, and table health can be customized in-game as long as you're a superadmin.
- Comes with HL2 and DarkRP weapon support by default.
- Comes with rock and tree entities that players can mine with a crowbar to obtain crafting ingredients.
- Category support for large amounts of items.
- Icons next to each recipe to let the player know if it's able to be crafted, close to having enough materials to be crafted, or can't be crafted.
- Developer functions to help addon and server developers integrate their own systems with this one. You can find more info about that [here.](https://github.com/LambdaGaming/Crafting_System/blob/master/dev.md)
- Automation option that allows users to tell the table to repeatedly craft a certain item as long as it has enough ingredients.
